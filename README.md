# Experimental-Materials-and-Data-of-Sour-Grapes

## Paper Abstract 论文摘要

Inspired by Aesop's fable of the fox and the grape, our study, consisting of three experiments (N=173), illustrates how individuals respond to failure by disregarding the significance of future goals. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either positive or negative feedback, pertaining to cognitive testing exercises (Study 2-3) or academic performance (Study 1). In comparison to those who received favorable feedback, participants exposed to unfavorable feedback anticipated feeling less content about their optimal future performance. Notably, even if participants achieved the highest scores in the actual testing, those who received negative feedback still reported lower levels of happiness. We term this phenomenon the "sour grape effect." However, owing to the limited sample size and an incomplete experimental design, the potential explanatory mechanism was not conclusively validated in this study.

## Material description 实验材料说明

Three folders store the **experimental data, primary experimental materials, and preregistration materials** for the three studys, along with PowerPoint presentations for creating visuals.

三个文件夹存储三个实验的实验原始数据、主要实验材料和预注册材料，以及用于创建图像的PowerPoint演示文稿。

It should be emphasized that for Study 1, I employed two different questionnaires to assess two distinct conditions. However, given that the different questionnaire versions solely vary in the order of the questions, I have retained only one version of the experimental questionnaire in the Study 1 folder.

需要强调的是，我们在研究 1 中使用了两个不同的问卷来测量两种不同的情况。然而，我们考虑到不同的问卷版本只是问题顺序不同，所以我在研究1的文件夹中只保留了一个版本的实验问卷。
